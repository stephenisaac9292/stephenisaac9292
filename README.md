# Hey, I'm Isaac! ðŸ‘‹

I break things to understand how they work.

## What I Do

I build projects to learn, not the other way around. 

## Stack I've Touched

**Languages:** Typescript(React, Nesjs), Python(Django, FastApi)

**Things I've Learned By Building:**
- Redis (caching, sessions, real-time data)
- Docker (containerization, environments)
- CI/CD Pipelines (automation, deployments)
- IaaS (infrastructure, cloud services)
- Microservices (distributed systems, architecture)

I don't believe in "mastering one framework." I believe in using the right tool for the job â€“ which means knowing a lot of tools.

## Philosophy

Every abandoned project is a lesson learned. Every completed one is a milestone. I'm collecting both.
